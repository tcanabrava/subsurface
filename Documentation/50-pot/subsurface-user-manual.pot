"_CSV_ is an abbreviation for a data file format: _Comma-Separated "
"Values_. It is a file format that allows you to view or edit information "
"using a text editor like Notepad (Windows), gedit (Linux) or TextWrangler "
"(OS/X). There are two main advantages of the _CSV_ format.  First, the data "
"are easily editable as text without any proprietary software.  Second, all "
"information is human-readable, not obscured by any custom or proprietary "
"attributes that proprietary software inserts into files.  Because of its "
"simplicity the _CSV_ format is used as an interchange format between many "
"software packages, e.g. between spreadsheet, statistical, graphics, database "
"and diving software. Within _Subsurface_, _CSV_ files can also be used to "
"import information from other sources like spreadsheet-based dive logs and "
"some dive computers."

"_CSV_ files can be created or edited with a normal text editor. The most "

"exporting data from spreadsheet software, the field separator needs to be "

"organized into a single line that provides the headers (or _field names_) of "
"the data columns, followed by the data, one record per line. Note that each "
