"Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with "
"extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba "
"and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar "
"software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux "
"(many distributions), Android and iOS. In addition, _Subsurface_ is "
"open-source software that allows downloading dive information from most dive "

"_Subsurface-mobile_ is an extension of _Subsurface_ which runs on Android "
"smartphone and tablet devices and is a tool for viewing or sharing dive "
"information at dive sites where a larger computer is not "
"useful. _Subsurface-mobile_ for Android also allows the gathering of GPS "
"locations where dives are performed (Subsurface-mobile for iOS currently "
"does not support GPS functionality)."

"_Subsurface-mobile_ allows you to enter and save dive information using a "
"mobile device. Most users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the mobile "
"app as an extension to the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.  This "
"allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet sharing them between the "
"mobile and the desktop versions. But _Subsurface-mobile_ can be used "
"independently of _Subsurface_ and does not require the use of cloud "
"storage.  While the desktop version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed "
"information for each dive, the mobile version allows a more accessible dive "
"log on a dive trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to "
"review previous dives."
